### CPSC 120

* Lab 03
    Lab 3 part-1 was one of my favorite labs because we were able to learn new commands. It allowed us to get used to std::string, cout and cin commands. I felt like it was a nice lab to work on specially for those of us who have not programmed and this was one of our first experiences. 
* Lab 12
    Lab 12 part-1 was by far one of the best labs that I have worked on because it really pulled everything we had learned together. It allowed me not just to learn more about the animation and color programs but it also allowed me to recall all the other programs that we had formerly worked on. It was really fun seeing it all come together as one and it was also challenging learning how to work through many functions. 
* Lab 06
    Lab 6 part-1 was definitely one of the most challenging labs that I had to work on but now looking back I really enjoyed it because of the challenge. It was a lab where I had to think outside of the box and really look back at the reading and note to really try to program it. It took me and my partner a long time to finish outside of the classroom but it was the challenge that made it interesting.
